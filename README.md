- 👋 Hi, I'm Evgenia Lashukova, I live in St. Petersburg.
- 👀 I'm a beginner frontend developer. I am proficient in the basic stack of HTML, CSS, JS. I actively use React + Redux. I am also learning Vue and I want to master it well.
The plans are to fix TypeScript well.
- 🌱 I am now studying on my own, inventing my own projects, learning new technologies. I am actively looking for a job or internship.
- 💞️From a hobby: I like to walk a lot, ride a scooter. In the summer I go diving and snorkeling whenever possible.
- In my opinion my best projects are: 
  - **SPA на React + JS, Redux** - https://github.com/sanny410/posts-users
  - **SPA на React + JS** - https://github.com/sanny410/list-user-info
  - **Мини приложение на Vue + JS** - https://github.com/sanny410/beer-recommendation
